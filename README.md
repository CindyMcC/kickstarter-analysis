## Project Overview

### Purpose
This project is a review of various theater funding campaigns from 2009 to 2017, focusing on the campaign launch date.   It also provides a closer look at theatrical plays and their goal outcomes.

We are looking at data on fundraising for theater productions to determine whether the dates and goal amounts affect the chance of a successful campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Funding campaigns started in May, June, or July had the highest chance of a successful outcome.  May had the highest number of launches and successes.  November and December had the fewest total new launches and January had the most canceled. An overview of the analysis can be found here: (resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
The data combined all campaigns with a parent type of theater, not considering the subcategory type or the goal amount.  Therefore, a project with a $1000 goal has the same final weight as one with a $100,000 goal.  An analysis based on launch date and funding amount may provide a clearer picture of successful timeframes for smaller or larger projects.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This analysis looked at data for plays only.  The highest percentage of successful campaigns was for under $5000.  Projects over $45,000 have a low chance of making their goal.  
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
It is unknown how many goals were revised during the campaign, either higher or lower.  The length of the campaign is also an unknown.  A view of the outcomes per campaign months could be helpful in determining an average timeframe for fundraising.
The money amounts were based on different currency types from various countries.  A clearer overview would be to translate all amounts to the same currency.
Based on the divisions requested, four plays were not included in the count.  All four had a goal of $50,000 and failed in reaching their goal.  There was no amount grouping listed that would include them.

## Results
The analysis indicates that projects under $40,000 or which were started during May or June have the best chance of attaining their funding goals.  Additional analysis may show a connection between amounts, start dates, and campaign lengths.
